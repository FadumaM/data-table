data-table-developer-assesment
==============================

This test is designed to demostrate your front end development skills.  You should be prepared to spend at least two hours on it.

We are looking for:

* Semantic HTML markup
* Well structured, easy to read JavaScript
* Good CSS (BEMs methodology will impress us)
* An understanding of good UX principles

The file `data.json` includes the monthly number of broadcasts per BBC channel for the year 2009.  Using the `index.html` file, we would like you to develop a small JS application that takes the JSON data and renders it into a nice data table.  We've already started the code for you.

Within approximately two hours we would expect:

* A small JavaScript application that takes the data as a parameter and renders out a HTML table into the body of the HTML document.
* Some UX on the the table to make it look nice
* Human readable date formats
* Make the table sortable

Additionally, by spending another hour on it you could:

* Add a dropdown select element above the table to make the data filterable

Please note:

* Just get it working on Chrome in your development computer.
* Extra marks for not using jQuery
* If you want to really blow us away then add a visualisation below the table that renders the data into some kind of chart.
